# MSP430-Bonsai-Caretaker

This project utilizes two PID loops to keep water levels in two different containers at a set point. It also utilizes almost all functions of the MCU, such as interrupts, digital/analog inputs, timer interrupts, PWM, low power mode, and serial communication, which makes it ideal for a university module project. 

An ESP8266 is also integrated in order to provide IoT capabilities.
